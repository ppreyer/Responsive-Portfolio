# Responsive-Portfolio

## Overview
This is my first ever application created to display completed programming projects. The page is created from scratch without the aid of a CSS framework.  The only difference between this repo and the Basic-Portfolio repo is the CSS file in this repo includes media queries to enhance the user's mobile experience.  The website consists of three pages: 1. About 2. Portfolio 3. Contact

Please preview the page here: https://ppreyer.github.io/Responsive-Portfolio/
